# ATTiny85-Easy-Debugging
Making it easier to program the ATTiny85 - see video #84 here: https://www.youtube.com/c/RalphBacon

So you have your ATTiny85 all connected up and running your latest sketch. Great. Oh, not great? Something is not quite right but you can't put your finger on what is wrong. Have you debugged the code? Oh, I SEE - YOU CAN'T because you can't connect the ATTiny85 to the USB port of your Arduino IDE, right?

Wrong. It's very easy to get your Tiny connected up to your Arduion IDE (or, indeed, any other serial monitor) to display all those useful Serial.println statements to find out just what is happening. But there are more ways than one to skin a c-- erm, let's not say that, Benny is watchg me type this! Suffice to say, there are some useful techniques over and above the obvious, so keep watching!

No sketch this week (as I'm demonstrating the method for ANY sketch) so it will be even easier than usual to implement this tip!

Send Only Software Serial Library
Included on the GitHub repository, just download, unzip and use! Thanks to Nick Gammon (again).

I also talk about using physical Pin 1 (P5) as a standard GPIO pin instead of it being reserved as a RESET pin. And talk about it is all I do here because you will have to wait for the next video on exactly how to do it -- oops! Benny says Shhh, stop giving away the plot, so I will stay stumm until that video arrives!
